#  Autonomous Robot Design & Manufacturing Project : AUTONOMOUS BASKETBALL PLAYING ROBOT SHOWCASE

# https://tunasafa.github.io/robot-design-and-manufacturing-/brobot.html

This project showcases the complete autonomous robot design and manufacturing developed by my team during my Master's in Robotics for robotics competition.

My Role & Contributions:
I was responsible for the mechanical design and engineering of the entire system. As the mechanics lead, I handled all aspects of the mechanical components, from initial design concepts through final manufacturing specifications.

Project Features:

- Complete robot documentation: You can find all technical information about the robot throughout the site
- Interactive 3D design: I didn't want to abandon the public accessibility of my 3D design work, so I embedded the complete CAD model into this showcase website
- Downloadable 3D files: You can download the complete 3D design files for your own use or reference
- Full 3D inspection: You can see all the parts, inspect individual components, separate parts for detailed analysis, and zoom in/out in full 3D
- Development timeline: You can follow the project chronologically through the integrated wiki page

Technical Implementation:

The site integrates my mechanical design work with web-based 3D visualization, allowing anyone to explore the robot's mechanical systems in detail.
This approach maintains public access to the technical work while providing comprehensive documentation of the development process.
This project represents complete autonomous robotics system development from mechanical design through competitive implementation.
